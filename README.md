## üìå Overview  # OS Lab Project

**Project:** OS Lab Project  
**Author:** Mihab Khan  
**Repository:** [mihabkhan/os_lab_project](https://github.com/mihabkhan/os_lab_project)
This project is developed for the Operating Systems (OS) lab course. The goal is to implement, test and demonstrate various OS-level concepts (such as scheduling, memory management, file systems, etc.) through hands-on code and simulations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features (example)  
- Simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin)  
- Memory allocation and de-allocation strategies  
- File system operations simulation  
- Concurrency & synchronization demonstrations  
- Test suite for validating each module  

*(Modify this list based on what your actual project implements.)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements & Setup  
1. Ensure you have a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) and `make` installed.  
2. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mihabkhan/os_lab_project.git
   cd os_lab_project
cd server
make
To run the server simulation:
./server
To execute tests:
cd tests
./run_concurrent_tests.sh
